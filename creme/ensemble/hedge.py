class HedgeClassifier(collections.UserDict, base.BinaryClassifier):
    """A binary classifier that uses the Hedge algorithm to mix models.

    Parameters:
        models (list): The set of models to hedge.
        weights (list): The initial weight of each model. If ``None`` then a uniform set of
            weights is assumed. This roughly translates to the prior amount of trust we have in
            each model.
        loss (optim.Loss): The loss function that has to be minimized.
        learning_rate (float): The learning rate by which the model weights are multiplied at each
            iteration.

    Example:
